# HEY HO!

This package let's you easily add a `HEY HO!` to your app.

Simply import the package and add the HwyHoView with the desired fontSize.

`HeyHoView(fontSize: 10)` 

This will add a Simple and styled HEY HO! to your View. But you can also use the `.heyHoModifier(fontSize: CGFloat)` to any object that conforms to the View protocol.  

This first version only supports static sizes, but future releases may come that supports dynamic sizing.

If you don't understand why this package exists, you missed the [ARCtic conference](https://arcticonference.com) in 2026.
