# HEY HO!

This package let's you easily add a `HEY HO!` to your app.

Simply import the package and add the HwyHoView with the desired fontSize.

`HeyHoView(fontSize: CGFloat)` 

This will add a Simple and styled HEY HO! to your View.

 You can also use the `.heyHoModifier(fontSize: CGFloat)` to any object that conforms to the View protocol. Note, that the modifier has only been tested on short sentences and may look silly on anything other than `Text()`.   

This first version only supports static sizes, but future releases may come that supports dynamic sizing.

If you don't understand why this package exists, you obviously didn't attend the App Roast at [ARCtic conference](https://arcticonference.com) in 2026.
